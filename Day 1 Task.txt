1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web and is used by browsers to load web pages.

HTTP1.1

=> Version 1.1 was released in 1997 and became the Internet Standard. 
=> This version added many performance enhancements, including keepalive connections, caching mechanisms, request pipelining, transfer encodings, and byte-range requests.
=> It works on the textual format.	
=> There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.	
=> It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages	
=> It compresses data by itself.	


HTTP2

=> Released in February 2015 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) focussed on improving HTTP performance.
=> It works on the binary protocol.
=> It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
=> It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
=> It uses HPACK for data compression.

2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

A JavaScript object is a collection of named values having state and behavior (properties and method).

For example: Person, car, pen, bike, Personal Computer , Washing Machine etc.

Syntax:
var car = "Mercedes";

Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

The following code assigns many values (Mercedes, C-class, White and soo on) to a variable named Car:

var car = {
Make: “Mercedes”, 
Model: “C-Class”, 
Color: “White”, 
Fuel: Diesel, 
Weight: “850kg”, 
Mileage: “8Kmpl”, 
Rating: 4.5
};

Ex: To print the above object

console.log(car.Make); // print the make of car

o/p:
Mercedes
